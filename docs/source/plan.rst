The plan
========

The plan for becoming a freelancer.

Being a freelancer consists for many skills:

* Technical Skills

* Soft Skills

* Management Skills

* Selling Skills

* Searching for jobs Skills

This project aims at facilitating the search of jobs by automating the search.

A freelancer can spend hours searching for a job in sites like freelancer and
upwork and others.

The trick is being specific and choosing a niche, the more specific the search
the less jobs offers one will read.

The less jobs offers one reads the less time one dedicates to reading, this
projects aims at minimazing the time spend in reading job offers in popular
sites like upwork and freelancer and maximizing the hiring rate vs time ratio.

In other words, if I expend 30 hours a month searching for a job just to get
10 hours of work charged I have 10/30 = 0.33 ratio of working/searching
but if I spend only 5 hours a month searching for a job and I charge 10 hours
that month that means that the ratio is 10/5 = 2 and I am more productive
because I am expending less time searching for jobs vs charging for my time,
This project aims at maximazing that ratio, by automating searching for jobs.
